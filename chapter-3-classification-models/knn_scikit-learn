"""he dataset SDSS contains 17 observational features and one class feature for 10000 deep sky objects observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Use sklearn's KNeighborsClassifier() function to perform kNN classification to classify each object by the object's redshift and u-g color.

    Import the necessary modules for kNN classification
    Create dataframe X with features redshift and u_g
    Create dataframe y with feature class
    Initialize a kNN model with k=3
    Fit the model using the training data
    Find the predicted classes for the test data
    Calculate the accuracy score using the test data"""
