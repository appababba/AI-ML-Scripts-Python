# zyBooks AI & ML Python Problem Sets

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python problem sets completed as part of zyBooks coursework on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The problem sets cover foundational and advanced topics in AI and ML, including classification, regression, deep learning, decision trees, ensemble models, clustering, support vector machines, and dimensionality reduction. These exercises were completed to deepen my understanding of AI/ML concepts and their implementation in Python.
