## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/appababba/zyBooks-AI-ML-Python-Problem-Sets.git

2. **Install Dependencies**:

    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
    Install required libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow) using:
    bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    Note: If a requirements.txt file is not included, check individual scripts for required libraries.

3. **Run the Code**:

    Navigate to a specific chapter folder (e.g., cd chapter-3-classification-models).
    Run a script using:
    bash

python script_name.py
