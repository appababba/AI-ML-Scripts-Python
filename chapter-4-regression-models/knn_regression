"""
The diamonds dataset contains the price, cut, color, and other characteristics of a sample of nearly 54,000 diamonds. This data can be used to predict the price of a diamond based on its characteristics. Use sklearn's KNeighborsRegressor() function to predict the price of a diamond from the diamond's carat and table values.

    Import needed packages for regression.
    Initialize and fit a k-nearest neighbor regression model using a Euclidean distance metric and k=12.
    Predict the price of a diamond with the user-input carat and table values.
    Find the distances and indices of the 12 nearest neighbors for the user-input instance
