"""
The diamonds dataset contains the price, cut, color, and other characteristics of a sample of nearly 54,000 diamonds. This data can be used to predict the price of a diamond based on its characteristics. Using a sample of the dataset and scikit-learn's LinearRegression() function, predict the price of a diamond from the diamond's carat and table values. Using scikit-learn's metrics module, calculate the various regression metrics for the model.

    Initialize and fit a multiple linear regression model.
    Use the model to predict the prices of instances in X.
    Calculate mean absolute error for the model.
    Calculate mean squared error for the model.
    Calculate root mean squared error for the model.
    Calculate R-squared for the model.
